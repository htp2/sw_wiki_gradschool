# Purpose
This wiki is provided "as-is" as a resource to future students, researchers, engineers, etc. It contains an unofficial, loose collection of information and links to SW I created, edited, found useful, etc. during my PhD at Johns Hopkins University (JHU).

At times, links may be to internal JHU repositories that are private (e.g. if they start with git.lcsr.jhu.edu). Unless these repositories contain soon-to-be-published proprietary information of other students, a curious/interested party should be able to access them via contact with Drs. Russell H. Taylor or Mehran Armand at JHU, or whoever currently is maintaining these software repositories for the Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR) at JHU

This is *not* my dissertation, I will provide contemporaneous thoughts, opinions, tips, etc. I will attempt to cite collaborators, etc. when appropriate, but please see the dissertation for full context and attribution.

I hope this information can be helpful to you.
